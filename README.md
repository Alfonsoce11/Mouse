# Mouse

A computer mouse I designed for hackclub's squeak YSWS (You Ship, We Ship).

It uses [this](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/wireless-mouse-components-kit-002?id=41806859403400) mouse kit.

It consists of 3 parts, not including the pcb. I designed the base and the battery cover first following the squeak tutorial [here](https://squeak.hackclub.com/design). To design the top part I started with a sketch near the middle of the mouse and then I used the loft tool to connect it to the base. Then I made a sketch to put space for the scroll wheel and also to seperate the buttons to be able to press down on them to click the buttons below them.

I also added parts on the base to keep the top part in place and I also added a hole for a screw.
